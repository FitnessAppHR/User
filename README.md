# Description

## Ascent is a fitness app inspired by at home workouts of COVID-19.
### Using React Native focusing on iOS, I worked on the app's user overview, including profile page, friends list mock, and user analytics which were built using D3JS. All built in 5 days.


### **This preview contains my work specifically for the app, not the final, combined product.**
